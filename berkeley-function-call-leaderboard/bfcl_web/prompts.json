        "user": "Given a topic, I want one random fact about this topic. \n\nThe fact must:\n- taken anywhere from the internet, preferrably not from Wikipedia.\n- be factual, with a web source to back it up.\n- require a web search to verify. This means that the fact is obscure enough that a web search is needed to verify it. (e.g. operating loss from a specific month)\n- be generic enough to apply to any other topic. It is fine if this fact can be applied to other topics. Actually, it's preferrable if it can!\n- be as short as concise as possible (i.e. do not use 'and's to chain facts).\n\nMost importantly, the fact must not lead back to the topic. What this means is that:\n- the fact should not be unique to the topic (e.g. a slogan of a company can easily identify the company, or a color scheme)\n\nTest that the fact does not easily lead back to the topic by doing the following:\n1. After finding the fact, rephrase the fact to make it sound as generic as possible. Use the follow strategies, but you are not limited to them:\n- Make pronouns gender neutral e.g. he -> they\n- Remove as many possible details as possible e.g. On September 29 2021, Alaska Airlines rolled out a special orange-and-black paint scheme on Airbus A320 tail N855VA -> In the 2020s, an airline used a special paint scheme for this company.\n2. Do a web search of the fact that you just found.\n3. If the topic is returned within the top few results, then it's a bad fact. You must choose a new fact.\n\nHere are some examples of good facts:\n- This company had an operating income of $3 million in FY24 (you need a web search to verify this, and you are not able to easily identify the company from this fact alone).\n- This person's most cited paper is published before 1990 (you also need a web search to verify this, and you need multiple searches to find the paper, and then the date of publication).\n- They wrote a song that is 3 minutes and 59 seconds (even though the numbers are specific, there are too many songs with that length).\n- This school offered the International Baccalaureate program (even though the program might be well-known, there are too many schools that offer it).\n- In 2018, they weighed 48 kg (a web search is needed to verify this, and there is no way to reverse engineer who this person is).\n\nHere are some examples of bad facts:\n- In 2009, a National League franchise became Major League Baseball's first team to roll out full-season dynamic ticket pricing, doing so with software partner Qcue (a web search of this fact immediately leads to the topic of the San Francisco Giants).\n- On September 29 2021, Alaska Airlines rolled out a special orange-and-black paint scheme on Airbus A320 tail N855VA and celebrated by donating $100,000 to the Willie Mays Scholarship Fund (this fact is too specific and can easily be searched; this also includes two facts).\n\nReturn the random generic fact in one sentence. \nDo not include the topic in the fact.\n\nNow, it's your turn. Here is the topic: {}."

If not, you do not have to rephrase.\n\nHere are some strategies you can use, but you are not limited to them:\n- Make pronouns gender neutral e.g. he -> they\n- Remove specific details \ne.g. private-owned Germany university -> place (\"private-owned\", and \"German\" are probably not important. \"university\" can be generalised into a place).\n\nHere are some examples of good changes:\n- Original fact 1: He was born on July 1, 1960, in Wakayama, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan\n- Good revised fact 1: He was born in 1960 in Japan.\n- Reason 1: July 1, 1960 is too specific of a date, and Wakayma is too specific of a place. The revised fact is still factual, but is more generic.\n\nHere are some examples of bad changes:\n- Original fact 1: a pair of shoes.\n- Bad revised fact 1: two shoes.\n- Reason 1: This replaces \"a pair\" with \"two\" which are just synonyms rather than making it more generic. You can leave the original fact as-is.\n- Original fact 2: three pieces of candy.\n- Bad revised fact 2: a few pieces of candy.\n- Reason 2: This replaces \"three\" with \"a few\", which cannot is too vague. A better replacement would be \"between one and five\" as that can be verified.\n\nNow, it's your turn. This is your fact: {}."
