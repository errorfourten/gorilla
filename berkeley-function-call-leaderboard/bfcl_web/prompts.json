This means that the fact cannot be commonly known.\n    * be preferably generic enough to apply to any other topic.\n    * be as short and concise as possible (i.e. do not use 'and's to chain facts).\n\n* **More importantly, the fact must not lead back to the topic.** What this means is that:\nthe fact must not be unique to the topic (e.g. a slogan of a company can easily identify the company, or a color scheme)\n* Test that the fact does not easily lead back to the topic by doing the following:\n    * Do a web search of the fact that you just found.\n    * If the topic is returned within the top few results, then it's a bad fact. You must choose a new fact.\n\n## Output format\n* You should return both \n    1. the fact\n    2. source URL you found the fact from - it should follow the format of a URL\n\n# Examples\n\nHere are some examples of good facts:\n\n<good_examples>\n<example1>\n<user>Give me a fact about Shake Shack.</user>\n<assistant>They had an operating income of $3 million in FY24.</assistant>\n<reason>You need a web search to verify this, and you are not able to easily identify the company from this fact alone.</reason>\n</example1>\n\n<example2>\n<user>Give me a fact about John Aloimonos.</user>\n<assistant>Their most cited paper is published before 1990.</assistant>\n<reason>You need a web search to verify this fact, and you need multiple searches to find the paper, and then the date of publication.</reason>\n</example2>\n\n<example3>\n<user>Give me a fact about Altiyan Childs.</user>\n<assistant>They wrote a song that is 3 minutes and 59 seconds.</assistant>\n<reason>Even though the numbers are specific, there are too many songs with that length.</reason>\n</example3>\n\n<example4>\n<user>Give me a fact about Centennial High School.</user>\n<assistant>They offered the International Baccalaureate program.</assistant>\n<reason>Even though the program might be well-known, there are too many schools that offer it to pin-point it to a single school.</reason>\n</example4>\n\n<example5>\n<user>Give me a fact about The Twin's at St Claire's.</user>\n<assistant>The author’s first book was a collection of poems which was dedicated to David, Brian, Peter, and John.</assistant>\n<reason>This fact is not about the book itself, but the author which is good.

Analyse how they used the clues to come to their answer.\n\n## Scenarios\nThere are three possible scenarios:\n\n### Case 1: High expert confidence, but guess and answer do not match.\n* This indicates that there could be more than one answer to the puzzle.\n* First, understand the puzzle solver's thought process and analyse why they are so confident in their answer.\n* Once you do so, you should go back to fact-selection and select new facts. Try not to select facts that made the puzzle solver very sure of their alternate answer. You could also select an additional different fact if that avoids the alternate answer.\n* You should aim to narrow down the puzzle to having one unique answer.\n* Then return the refined puzzle you have crafted.\n\n### Case 2: High expert confidence, and guess and answer do match.\n* This indicates that the puzzle is probably too simple.\n* First, understand the puzzle solver's thought process and analyse how they came to the answer.\n* Once you do so, you should go back to fact-selection and either obfuscate the facts that gave the answer away or select another set of facts.
